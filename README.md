## 📂 Standard Folder Structure (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL Projects)

```
index.html
css/
    style.css
script/
    script.js
include/
    header.php
    footer.php
    functions.php
ajax/
    fetch_page.php
```

🔹 **Guidelines:**  
- All file and folder names must begin in **lowercase only**.  
- Spaces are not allowed – use **underscore** (`_`) instead.  
- Example: `fetch_page.php` ✅ instead of `Fetch Page.php` ❌  

---

## 📄 File Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names relevant to the file’s functionality.  
- Example: `user_profile.php`, `batch_report.sql`

---

## 📝 Variable Naming Conventions
- Use **camelCase** for variables.  
- Examples:  
  - `srNo`  
  - `batchNo`  
  - `userEmail`  

---

## 🔀 Git Commit Guidelines

**Commit Message Format:**
```
YourName/FeatureName
YourName/FixDetails
```

Examples:  
- `Sarang/LoginPage`  
- `Sarang/FixLoginIssue`  

---

## 📌 Pull Request Guidelines

**PR Naming Convention:**
```
[YourName] FeatureName / BugName
```

Examples:  
- `[Sarang] Adding Login & Sign Up Page`  
- `[Meher] Fixing API Timeout Issue`  

---

## 💻 Coding Standards
- Follow proper indentation and code formatting.  
- Keep functions small, reusable, and well-documented.  
- Avoid hardcoding values – use constants or config files.  
- SQL queries should be formatted for readability.  
- Always sanitize inputs before database operations.  

---

## ⚙️ Environment Setup
- Recommended IDE: **VS Code** with extensions for PHP, JS, and linting.  
- Configure Git in your system with your official email and username.  
- Use Prettier/ESLint for JS and PHPCS for PHP to maintain formatting.  

---

## 🆕 Onboarding Guide
- Install required tools (VS Code, Git, MySQL, PHP, Apache/XAMPP).  
- Clone the repository and follow the [Folder Structure](#-standard-folder-structure-html-css-js-php-sql-projects).  
- Review Git commit & PR guidelines before your first contribution.  
- Pair up with a mentor/lead for your first code review.  

---

## ✅ Contribution Guidelines
- All updates to this handbook or codebase must be done via **Pull Requests (PRs)**.  
- Each PR should follow the defined [PR Naming Convention](#-pull-request-guidelines).  
- At least **one approval** from a team lead is required before merging.  

---
